# Magento1_Stock_Notify_by_Email
Send an email when something gets out of stock, sorry hardcoded, but I like the things to be easy
Another smallll extension for Magento 1, to keep it clean we don't have a gui, config is done in the file itself. 
Sorry in this initial release the emailaddress is in the observer file, 
but cleaner and faster than his I can not make it.

If you find it useful, please like my project.

Thanks!

La revedere,

Paul
