# Magento1_Stock_Notify_by_Email
Send an email when something gets out of stock, sorry hardcoded, but I like the things to be easy
Another smallll extension for Magento 1, to keep it clean we don't have a gui, config is done in the file itself. 
Sorry in this initial release the columns to remove from the sales grid are mentioned in the observer file, 
but cleaner and faster than his I can not make it.

If you find it useful, please send me a little bitcoin here : https://zwagerman.bitcoinwallet.com/

Thanks!

La revedere,

Paul
